"""One-off page fixes that regeneration cannot derive. Run after
drive_sync.py + dedupe_titles.py, in that order.

Each fix asserts its precondition so a silent no-op is impossible: the fix is
either applied (old pattern found), already applied (new pattern found), or an
error. Idempotent: re-running after a regeneration re-applies exactly the same
edits. --check reports each fix's state without writing.

Usage:
    python scripts/examples_sync/apply_oneoffs.py [--check | --refresh-preserve-baseline]

- **Transcript Generation**: Provides simultaneous text transcription of generated audio
- **WAV File Creation**: Saves streamed audio directly to a WAV file format
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for audio decoding

## Use Cases

- Interactive voice assistants
- Real-time storytelling applications
- Audio content generation
- Voice-enabled chatbots
- Dynamic audio responses for applications

## Technical Details

The example configures audio streaming with 24kHz sample rate, mono channel, and 16-bit sample width. The streaming approach allows for real-time audio playback while maintaining high audio quality through the PCM16 format.""",

- **Streamed output**: Consumes audio chunks as the model returns them
- **PCM16 format**: Writes 16-bit PCM audio at 24 kHz in mono
- **Transcript output**: Prints transcript chunks as they arrive
- **WAV file**: Saves the audio stream to `tmp/response_stream.wav`
- **Decode failures**: Prints chunk decoding failures and continues consuming the stream

| Transcribe audio | [Audio to Text](/multimodal/agent/usage/audio-to-text) |
| Continue an audio conversation | [Audio Multi-Turn](/multimodal/agent/usage/audio-multi-turn) |

## Output Format

The agent writes 24 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM audio to `tmp/response_stream.wav`. The script saves the stream to disk. It does not play the audio.""",
